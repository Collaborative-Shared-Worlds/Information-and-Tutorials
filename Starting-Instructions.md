Information and Tutorials
=========================

There are a few steps you need to take before contributing to the Workshop project.

1. Read the [Starting Instructions](https://github.com/Worldbuilding-Workshop/Information-and-Tutorials/blob/master/Starting-Instructions.md). These outline some basic guidelines and rules for working with the Workshop team.
2. Get [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) (if you're on Windows) or follow the [GitHub instructions for setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-all).
2a. (optional) Learn how to use Git, if you're using Git not GitHub for Windows. You can read our own [tutorial](https://github.com/Worldbuilding-Workshop/Information-and-Tutorials/blob/master/How%20to%20use%20Git/How%20to%20use%20Git.pdf) on this subject for a quick masterclass.


3. You are now ready to start contributing. Pick a project to contribute to. In the relevant repository, the README.md file should show you the ground rules and project co-ordinator: follow the rules, and contact the co-ordinator to gain edit access to the repository.
