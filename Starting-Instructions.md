## Welcome to CSW.

Collaborative Shared Worlds is a project [born](http://meta.worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/q/341/2685) on [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/). We aim to create free (both as in 'free beer' and as in 'free speech') fictional settings for anyone to use, not matter what their purpose.
