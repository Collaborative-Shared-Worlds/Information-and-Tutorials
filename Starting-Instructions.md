# Welcome to the Workshop.

## 1. About the Workshop
Worldbuilding Workshop is a collaborative effort to create free (as in 'free beer' and as in 'free speech') fantasy settings for anyone to use in their projects - writing, map-making, RPG campaigns - anything! The project was born and is co-ordinated from [Worldbuilding Stack Exchange](http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/).

## 2. Want to help out?
Great! We'd love to have you, we're looking for more contributors. There are a few points to make clear first.

**Project Co-ordination**  
The project is co-ordinated overall by our *co-ordinators*, J-F-B-M and ArtOfCode-. They have the final say in Workshop matters. We then have our *moderators*, who are members of the Owners team and can add contributors, new repositories, and generally help keep the project in good shape. Next we have *world managers* - people who've come up with setting ideas, are the main contributors to them, and are responsible for all matters about that world and its repository.

**Pick a Project**  
Our projects are listed on the organization's home page. Pick one you like the sound of, then either drop into [this chatroom on Stack Exchange](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/17796/worldbuilding-workshop) and ask for access, or if you don't have an account, open an issue here using the issue tracker on the Help-Center repository, and ask for access to the world's repository. You will be added to a team of contributors for that world. You can contribute to a maximum of 3 worlds at the same time, to ensure you're not stretching yourself too thin and ending up only making small contributions in each world. You may be considered for more projects once you've proved yourself.

**Follow the Conventions**  
We have a set of conventions here, which help to keep projects in order. We expect you to follow them when contributing; if they are not followed then a higher-level user may edit or delete your contributions to bring them in line. Continued patterns of not following conventions will result in warnings and eventually revocation of your access - but we never expect things to go that far. The main conventions are these:

- Text files should be in one of the following formats: Markdown, LaTeX, plaintext or PDF.
- Controversial ideas should be checked out with the *world's* manager first. Don't come straight to mods or co-ordinators unless you've got a problem with the world manager.

There may also be other conventions defined per-world in the root of the world's repository - please check first.

## 3. Got a problem?
The Help-Center repository may have something applicable to your problem - check first. Other than that, if you have a problem, comment, request or anything for:

- A specific world: use that world's issue tracker.
- The Workshop project: use the Help-Center issue tracker.
- The mods or co-ordinators: use the Help-Center issue tracker.

## Enjoy contributing!
